// In the terminal, writing "node server.js" and a console.log just print this. Exits the program once it exits the file.
// nodemon is a way for us to say "we want to run this file, and keep it running". Monitor every time it changes, and when you run npm run dev. 
// If we do a mistake in the server.js, it'll catch it.
console.log("This is as nodez program")
console.log("This is as nodez program")

// nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

// nodemon does not require any additional changes to your code or method of development. nodemon is a replacement wrapper for node. To use nodemon, replace the word node on the command line when executing your script.
